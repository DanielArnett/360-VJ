This is the Resolume fork of the FFGL repository. It is up to date and has Visual Studio and Xcode projects to compile 32 bit and 64 bit plugins.

The master branch is FFGL 2.0. It is updated to be compatible with OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile. Plugins compiled with the master branch will work in Resolume 7.

To compile plugins for hosts that support FFGL 1.5 (Resolume 6, VDMX, COGE, Isadora, Magic Music Visuals), switch to the FFGL1.5 branch: https://github.com/resolume/ffgl/tree/ffgl1.5
