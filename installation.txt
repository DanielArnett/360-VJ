Installation

Compilation will result in a Freeframe plugin "ShaderMaker.dll".

Rename the file as necessary. You will already have entered the plugin information 
in the source code before compilation.

The dll can then be copied into the plugin folder for the host application.

Further details are in the ShaderMaker pdf.
