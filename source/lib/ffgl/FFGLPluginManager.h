///	\brief		CFFGLPluginManager manages information concerning a plugin inputs, parameters, and capabilities.
/// \authors	Gualtiero Volpe, Menno Vink (menno@resolume.com)
/// \version	2.0.0
///
/// The CFFGLPluginManager class is the base class for FreeFrameGL plugins developed with the FreeFrameGL SDK since it provides
/// them with methods for automatically manage information concerning plugin inputs, paramaters, and capabilities.
/// Examples of information managed by this class are the number of inputs and parameters of a plugin; the name, type and
/// default value of each parameter.
/// Plugins developed with the FFGL SDK (and thus having this class as base class) should call the protected methods
/// of this class in order to specify the information related to their inputs and parameters. These calls
/// are usually done while constructing the plugin subclass. Plugins subclasses should also call methods of this class in
/// order to get information about the images they are going to process (i.e., their width and height).
/// The default implementations of the FFGL global functions call the public methods of this class in order to
/// return to the host information about a plugin.
